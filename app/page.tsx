                    The purpose of the internship (LIA) is to practically apply
                    theoretical and practical knowledge from the education and
                    gain experience working on real projects. The internship
                    offers a chance to be part of a professional team, work on
                    real assignments, and understand how communication and
                    problem-solving function in the profession and the working
                    life of a developer.

                    mplemented Features: Liquidity Selection and Management:
                    Users can choose a liquidity provider and place their
                    liquidity with the selected casino or operator. I
                    implemented the interface and functionality to make this
                    seamless while maintaining security and user-friendliness.
                    Profit and Liquidity Overview: Users can view their current
                    profit and withdraw their profit or liquidity as desired. I
                    designed and integrated this so that users have a clear
                    overview of their investments and current status. Currency
                    Exchange and Network Switching: An essential part of the
                    platform was enabling easy currency exchange between
                    different tokens and networks, such as USDT, USD, and other
                    relevant tokens. I implemented the necessary functionality
                    to ensure smooth transactions and user experience.
                    Statistics and Dynamic Data: To provide users with insights
                    into platform activity and performance, I included features
                    to display statistics such as Total Value Locked (TVL),
                    trading volume, and other relevant data. This helps users
                    make informed decisions about their investments.

                    My mentor was Mikael Bolmstam, an experienced fullstack
                    developer. He assigned me tasks, provided guidance, and gave
                    feedback on my work. During the LIA period, I received
                    support in solving technical challenges and improving my
                    skills in frontend development and project management.

                  <p className={styles.p}>
                    My goals and hopes of working with frameworks like React,
                    Next.js, and the JavaScript programming language were
                    fulfilled during my LIA, which was fantastic. Despite not
                    having much experience in fullstack development, I got to
                    work with some backend components like MongoDB and Node.js.
                    This was a challenge that helped me grow as a developer and
                    understand the importance of collaborating across technical
                    boundaries. An important insight from my LIA is the need to
                    strengthen my skills in troubleshooting and system design.
                    Despite my knowledge and previous experience, this proved to
                    be a key factor in handling complex projects like Liquidity
                    House effectively. I have learned that by being methodical
                    and following established processes, I can improve my
                    results and the efficiency of my efforts in the future.
                    Working with a dedicated team like DeGaming Group has also
                    taught me the importance of effective communication and
                    problem-solving. Through daily interactions with colleagues
                    and mentors, I have grown as an individual contributor and
                    as part of a larger organization. Being able to communicate
                    effectively and understand others&apos; perspectives has
                    been crucial in achieving our common goals during the LIA
                    period. My time at DeGaming has not only provided me with
                    valuable practical experience in modern web development and
                    integrating blockchain technology within iGaming but has
                    also strengthened my conviction that I have chosen the right
                    career. Having the opportunity to work with exciting
                    technologies and real projects has been an inspiring glimpse
                    into what the future holds in the IT industry. For my
                    continued development as a developer, I am particularly
                    interested in deepening my knowledge in backend and frontend
                    development, exploring new technologies that can improve
                    user experience and functionality of web applications. I
                    also look forward to applying my LIA experiences in future
                    projects and contexts and continuing to learn and grow
                    professionally in my field.

                    Conclusion and Discussion... <br />
                    Comparing theoretical education with practical experience
                    from the LIA shows that the entire IT industry is constantly
                    evolving. There are many ways to solve problems and work as
                    a developer, both individually and in teams, depending on
                    personal preferences, customer orders, and specific
                    requests. It is essential to be flexible and open to
                    suggestions and changes, as each workplace has its methods,
                    tools, and communication styles. A deeper understanding of
                    how code works behind the scenes and various programming

                    application varies.
